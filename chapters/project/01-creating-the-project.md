# Creating the project

## Choosing a workspace

Initially, we must choose where we will create our project inside our computer.

If you are in a Linux or Mac environment, a good place would be your user's folder:

```
/home/YOUR_USER/
```

If you are in a Windows environment, this directory will be:

```
C:\Users\YOUR_USER\
```

Inside this directory, create a folder with the following name:

```
workspace
```

And inside it, create another folder called:

```
game-store
```

If you are in a Linux or Mac environment, your path will be:

```
/home/YOUR_USER/workspace/game-store
```

But, if you are using Windows, your path will be:

```
C:\Users\YOUR_USER\workspace\game-store
```

**Remember**

Whenever you read a mention of the project **root directory** or **root path**, we are referring to this folder.


## Starting a Node Project

You will now need to use a command line terminal of your choice.
