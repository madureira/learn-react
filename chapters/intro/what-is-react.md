# What is React?

![](/images/image_0.png)

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a library that helps you to create user interface components.

Instagram initially created it (Facebook later bought Instagram and inherited React as a consequence), today it's maintained by the open-source teams from [Facebook](https://opensource.facebook.com/) that did an excellent job in disseminating and strengthening their adoption.

According to the definition of Facebook:

> React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

That is, React is not a Framework, but a library.

## Characteristics

### Declarative

The declarative Views makes your code more predictable and more comfortable to debug.

### Component-Based

Allows you to create sophisticated UI's, based on encapsulated components that manage their own state.

### Learn Once, Write Anywhere

React also can be rendered on the server-side using NodeJs. Imagine that you need to create a webpage and [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) it's an essential thing for your business, through server-side rendering, you can build your application using React and delivery the entire HTML for the http requests.

But if you desire to build a mobile app, don't worry, React can help you with it. Through [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), you will be able to create native Android and IOS applications, without having to learn other programming languages and frameworks.


## React and its ecosystem

You may be wondering:

> \- If React is just a library to create UI's, how can I build a whole application with it?

When we hear someone say that an application was created in ReactJs, what the person is saying is that the React library was combined with other libraries that are part of their ecosystem to build that app.

Often, this ecosystem is formed by the following tools:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#jsx)
- [ES6](http://es6-features.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) / [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) / [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) / [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

Don't worry! We'll look in detail, many of these tools.
