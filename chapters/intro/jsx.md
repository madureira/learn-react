# JSX

![](/images/image_005.png)

Let's consider the follow variable declaration:

```js
const element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
```

This Tag syntax is not a string or even an HTML.

This kind of statement is called **J**avaScript **S**yntax e**X**tension, or simply [**JSX**](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), and is nothing more than a syntax extension of JavaScript.
